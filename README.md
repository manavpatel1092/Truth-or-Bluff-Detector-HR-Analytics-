# Truth-or-Bluff-Detector-HR-Analytics
When HR planning indicates the need for additional labor, organizations have a number of choices to make. Careful HR planning must consider the overall growth prospects of the organization and accurate forecasting of future labor needs. Recruitment planning begins only when other alternatives have been considered and eliminated. When one finds a deserving candidate it must
decide on the salary of the candidate as per the industry standards.

In this project we need to make a truth or bluff detector for the HR recruitment salary negotiation process to check if a candidate is giving us the true information about his/her last drawn salary, using the database Position_Salaries.csv. We have a specific case of a potential employee candidate tells he has 20+ years (Level 6.5) of experience and earned 160,000 annual salary in his previous company. Therefore, he is asking now for at least more than 160,000. We need to determine if he deserves it and if he is telling the truth using random forest regression model.

Here we have three attributes in the dataset namely:
- Position (The position in the company) 
- Level (The level of position as decided by the Company Policy) 
- Salary (The salary drawn by personnelâ€™s at different position)
